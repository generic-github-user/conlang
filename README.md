# conlang

This repository stores data and scripts associated with my (as of yet unnamed) personal conlang (short for [constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language)). This project serves a few purposes;
 - Speeding up both digital and traditional note-taking
 - Better understanding language systems and dynamics as I dive deeper into Natural Language Processing (NLP)
 - Providing an efficient and precise interface for personal NLP-based systems (primarily a digital assistant I have been working on)

Anyone is free to use these tools if they find them helpful, although it should be noted that minimal attention was paid to making them universally helpful/easy to learn.
